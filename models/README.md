These synthetic spectral models were provided by Caroline Morley via email in April 2021.  They will eventually be published as part of a larger program.  Direct requests for models to C. Morley in the meantime.  The models take up about 1.7 GB uncompressed.

```bash
$ du -hs *
1.7G	models_forGully
655M	models_forGully.zip
```

Note that the flux units differ from the published cloud-free Sonora grid (cgs versus SI).
