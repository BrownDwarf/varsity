Condensate clouds should pervade the atmospheres of ultracool brown dwarfs and exoplanets, dictating the energy balance of these substars and controlling their photometric and spectroscopic properties. Yet physical understanding of these clouds has largely been limited to coarse phenomenology.  Clouds are difficult to model and even more difficult to observe, owing to the limitations of observing exoplanets near bright host-stars and faint ultracool LT dwarfs.

Last month Apai et al. 2021 presented the \emph{TESS} lightcurve of the nearest known brown dwarf system, Luhman 16AB, residing at a mere 2 pc from the Sun, it is our third closest neighbor. The proximity of this ultracool L7.5/T0.5 pair makes them the latest spectral type objects amenable to contemporaneous TESS monitoring and high fidelity ground-based observations.  Remarkably, the Sector 10 TESS lightcurve of Luhman 16 shows over 100 rotations with global peak-to-valley cloud-induced variations over 25 days exceeding 15\% (Figure 1).  These variations are caused by clouds of unknown extents, positions, thicknesses, and opacities.

Gemini did not observe Luhman 16 contemporaneously with TESS Sector 10 (March 26 - April 22, 2019).  We missed a key opportunity before, but will not miss it this time-- simultaneous monitoring will allow us to know the rotational phase (from TESS) and with high-resolution spectroscopy and TESS, we can disentangle the A/B components and variability.  

Here we propose multi-epoch IGRINS observations contemporaneous with continuous TESS Sector 36 monitoring, from March 8 - March 18.  The epochs can be scheduled randomly during this 10 day window, easing their burden on the queue.  With five epochs---and TESS-Sector-10-like modulations---we expect to sample a fux range of $\sim 8\%$ (Figure 2), corresponding to a cloud coverage change large enough to detect with IGRINS with $S/N\sim100$.  We will decompose the IGRINS spectra into three components: 1) Luhman 16A, assumed weakly variable; 2) Luhman 16B clouds; and 3) Luhman 16B cloud-free.  We will be able to uniquely disentangle these components because the TESS data informs the relative phase of cloud coverage.

One of our subfield's biggest unsolved problems remains the triggering mechanism responsible for the rapid clearing of clouds in the L-T transition phase.  Luhman 16AB offers an ideal laboratory for solving the L-T transition problem: it is a binary with one object on each side of the transition, it is variable, and it is 2 pc away. No other such objects exist. This proposed DDT program stands to catapult our field by providing a line-by-line decomposition of the spectrum of clouds across the entire $H-$ and $K-$ bands, where most of the flux escapes these ultracool brown dwarfs.  Our field's biggest unsolved problem can only be understood after we can accurately account for cloud physical chemistry.  Importantly, \textbf{these spectra will have tremendous archival legacy value for decades to come}, with the prospect for snapshot image reconstruction of the stellar surface, leveraging both the TESS lightcurve and IGRINS line profile perturbations.

While observations of Luhman 16 with IGRINS exist, none have occured contemporaneously with optical monitoring precise enough to inform the phase of modulation, yielding highly degenerate fits to a spectral decomposition triptych.  Our proposed experimental design dramatically reduces the otherwise-vast-permutations of conceivable spectral components that can fit inside a single composite IGRINS spectrum.  \textbf{The success of our program will instantly increase the value of existing IGRINS spectra of Luhman 16, since we can re-interpret spectra over multi-year baselines once we have faithfully disentangled the contribution of clouds.}

TESS is not currently scheduled to re-observed Luhman 16 after Sector 37, so it is urgent that we obtain these observations now.  There will be a short three-day April window for which we plan to pursue 3 epochs through Fast Turnaround (FT), but poor weather and queue demands introduce significant risk to FT alone.  TESS might reobserve Luhman 16 in its Cycle 5 around 2023, or possibly later depending on as-yet-undetermined TESS targeting strategies (ecliptic versus all-sky).

We will analyze the IGRINS spectra with state-of-the-art \texttt{Sonora} pre-computed synthetic spectral models of cloudy and cloud-free brown dwarf atmospheres developed by Co-I C. Morley (Marley et al. in prep).  Our team has developed two open source tools to conduct rapid data-model comparisons with the Sonora model grids. First, \texttt{intuition}\footnote{https://github.com/BrownDwarf/intuition} is a human-in-the-loop fitting procedure that rapidly provides best fits and upper and lower bounds on physical parameters such as $T_{eff}, \log{g}, v\sin{i}, RV$ and the \emph{veiling}-like signal from clouds.  Second, our group has implemented probabilistic spectral decomposition (Gully-Santiago et al. 2017) with the inference framework \texttt{Starfish}\footnote{https://github.com/iancze/Starfish} (Czekala et al. 2015).  We have applied the framework to high resolution brown dwarf spectra, with remarkable success (Zhang et al. 2021, Gully-Santiago et al. in prep.).  These tools are ready today, making it feasible to have a clear and rapid path to publication.

Luhman 16 is so bright that individual on-sky integrations should be comparable to the overhead time associated with acquiring the target, for a total visit time of 20 minutes.  For five epochs, we expect the entire program to take less than 2 hours.

Conspicuous large amplitude modulation attributable to a 5.28 day rotational modulation swells from 4\% to 10\%, and is associated with Luhman 16B.  A secular running-mean level trend of 10\% may arise from the ebb-and-flow of differentially rotating zonal circulation bands, analogous to a scaled-up Jupiter.}

The larger lever arm on cloud coverage fraction will make it easier to disambiguate the cloud and cloud-free spectral components.}

% OTHER FACILITIES OR RESOURCES
%
% This section should consist of text only (no figures).
% Please limit to about a half page of printed text.
%
% 1) We are interested in understanding how observations made through
% NOAO observing opportunities complement or support data from other
% facilities both on the ground and in space.   We will use this
% information to guide the evolution of the NOAO program; it will not
% affect the success of your proposal in the evaluation process.
% Please describe how the proposed observations complement data from
% other facilities, including private observatories and both ground-
% and space-based telescopes.  In addressing this question, take a
% broad view of your research program.  Are the data to be obtained
% through this proposal going to help select samples for detailed
% observations using larger telescopes or from space observatories?
% Are these data going to be directly combined with data obtained
% elsewhere to test a hypothesis?  Will these observations have
% relevance to other observations, even though the proposal stands
% on its own?  For each of these other facilities, indicate the nature
% of the observations (yours or those of others), and describe the
% importance of the observations proposed here in the context of the
% entire program.
%
% 2) Do you currently have a grant that would provide resources
% to support the data processing, analysis, and publication of the
% observations proposed here?

% OBSERVING RUN DETAILS - REQUIRED FOR EACH INSTRUMENT USED
%
% Describe the observations to be made during this observing run in
% the \technicaldescription section. Justify the specific telescope,
% the number of nights, the instrument, and the lunar phase requested.
% Use the Gemini Integration Time Calculator (ITC) for a typical source for each

% please state the time request for each site.

\technicaldescription


We request that the slit be rotated parallel to the PA of the Luhman 16 AB system, so that the relative flux of the components can be controlled under variable seeing conditions.  The components are close enough that standard ABBA nod patterns can still separate the two components, making standard IGRINS data reduction feasible.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% BAND 3 INFORMATION
% If you are applying for queue time, your ranking may place the program in
% Band 3.  Band 3 observations are used to fill the queue when no Band 1 or 2
% programs are available.  Successful Band 3 programs generally use poorer than
% median observing conditions, have targets away from the most popular
% regions of the sky, do not require strict timing or other constraints,
% and do not require special instrument configurations.  You should describe
% the changes you will make to the program to allow it to be successful in Band 3 in
% the \bandthreeplan section, or write "This program is not suitable for band 3"
% or "This is not a queue request". If a Band 3 allocation is acceptable and
% the total Band 3 time request is different from the standard request, then
% give the Band 3 time request for each partner. and update the time requested
%  from each site.

% CLASSICAL PROGRAM INFORMATION
% If you are applying for classical time on Gemini, please enter ``Y'' in the
% curly braces of the \classical command; otherwise enter ``N''.  Classical
% proposals should define a backup program in case the weather is worse than
% the observing conditions in the proposal.  Enter your classcial backup
% in the \classicalbackup section.

% DUPLICATE OBSERVATIONS
% A search of the Gemini Observatory Archive
% (https://archive.gemini.edu) will reveal whether
% Gemini has previously been used to observe your targets using similar or
% identical observing setups.  If there are duplicate observations, please
% justify why new observations should be taken in the \justifyduplications
% section.  If the Archive search finds no duplicates, please enter
% ``The GOA search revealed no duplicate observations''.
